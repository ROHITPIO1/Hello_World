### Migration Document: Ownership Splits Logic Flow  

#### **Overview**  
This module manages the splitting of ownership interests for a lease/property. Key functions include:  
- **Initializing** ownership arrays.  
- **Displaying** original owner/lease details.  
- **Managing** a list of split owners (add/edit/validate).  
- **Calculating** new ownership percentages/interests.  
- **Updating** lease records and audit trails upon save.

### **Step-by-Step Logic Flow**  

#### **1. Initialization & Setup**  
- **Purpose**: Prepare data structures for ownership splits.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Reset arrays tracking owners, percentages, and interests if first access (`SPLFLG = '0'`).  
  - Set flag `SPLFLG = '1'` to mark subsequent accesses.  
  - Clear error indicators (e.g., `IN06`, `IN70`).  

#### **2. Display Original Owner Details**  
- **Purpose**: Show the current owner being split from.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Fetch owner details (name, address) from the owner master file (`MNOLFO`).  
  - Format city/state/zip for display (handles ZIP+4 logic).  
- **Error Handling**:  
  - If owner not found, flag `IN21` and log error `IO`.  

#### **3. Load Lease Details**  
- **Purpose**: Retrieve lease information to split.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Fetch lease data from the lease detail file (`MNDLFL`).  
  - Save original decimal interest (`SVDECI`) and operator (`SVSOPR`).  

#### **4. Restore Previous Splits**  
- **Purpose**: Reapply saved splits from prior sessions.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Loop through saved owners/percentages (`SVSO`, `SVSP`).  
  - For each valid entry:  
    - Add to current owner array (`SO`) if not duplicated.  
    - Fetch owner names from `MNOLFO` for display.  

#### **5. Populate Subfile (Display Grid)**  
- **Purpose**: List all split owners in a user-editable grid.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Clear subfile and remove duplicate owners.  
  - For each owner in the array (`SO`):  
    - Fetch owner details (name from `MNOLFO`).  
    - Calculate interest (`SI`) from percentage (`SP`).  
    - Validate:  
      - Owner exists (error `IO` if missing).  
      - Not the original owner (error `SO`).  
      - Interest between 0–100% (error `II` if invalid).  
  - Display subfile.  

#### **6. Handle User Actions**  
- **Purpose**: Process user inputs on the subfile.  
- **Actions**:  
  - **Add Owner (`INKEY = 'KP'`)**:  
    - Call program `MNOWFMW1` to select an owner.  
    - Add to first empty slot in the owner array.  
  - **Electronic Supplements (`INKEY = 'KQ'`)**:  
    - Open window to collect electronic supplement details (e.g., `COREAS`, `COYRAP`).  
    - Validate entries.  
  - **Save Splits (`INKEY = 'KH'`)**:  
    - Proceed to update records (Step 7).  
  - **Reload**: Refresh subfile if data changes.  

#### **7. Save Splits & Update Records**  
- **Purpose**: Commit splits to the database.  
- **Actions**:  
  - **For Each Split Owner**:  
    - **Update Lease (`MNDLFL`)**:  
      - Add new lease record or update interest in existing lease.  
      - Handle alternate owners if present.  
    - **Create Change Record (`MNDPR7`)**:  
      - Log split details (owner, new interest, timestamp, user).  
      - Generate sequence numbers for audit trail.  
    - **Electronic Supplements**: Write to `MNDPR8` if enabled.  
  - **Original Owner**:  
    - **Adjust Interest**: Reduce by total split interests.  
      - If remaining interest > 0: Update lease.  
      - If interest = 0: Delete lease record.  
    - **Log Change**: Record adjustment/deletion in `MNDPR7`.  

#### **8. Error Handling & Validation**  
- **Critical Checks**:  
  - All owners must exist in `MNOLFO`.  
  - Total split interests ≤ original interest (`DEC2 ≥ 0`).  
  - No duplicate owners in the split list.  
- **Errors**:  
  - `IO`: Owner not found.  
  - `SO`: Owner same as original.  
  - `II`: Invalid interest (≤0 or ≥100%).  
  - `IA`: Invalid alternate owner.  
- **Indicators**:  
  - `IN06`/`IN12`: Prevent save if errors exist.  
  - `IN70`: Enable save only if valid.  

#### **9. Finalization**  
- **Purpose**: Clean up and exit.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Release file locks (`LOCKDL = 'N'`).  
  - Reset flags/indicators.  
  - End subroutine.

### **Key Business Rules**  
1. **Original Owner**: Cannot be added as a split owner.  
2. **Interest Calculation**:  
   - `New Interest = Original Interest × Split Percentage`.  
   - Total split interests must not exceed original interest.  
3. **Electronic Supplements**:  
   - Optional step triggered by user.  
   - Requires valid `COREAS` code and year (`COYRAP`).  
4. **Audit Trail**:  
   - Every split generates a change record (`MNDPR7`) with sequence numbers.  
   - Original owner adjustments are logged.  

### **Notes for Non-Coders**  
- **Arrays**: Lists storing split owners (`SO`), percentages (`SP`), and interests (`SI`).  
- **Subfile**: A scrollable grid displaying split owners for user interaction.  
- **Indicators**: Flags (e.g., `IN70`) control what users can do (e.g., enable/disable save).  
- **Files**:  
  - `MNOLFO`: Owner master data.  
  - `MNDLFL`: Lease details.  
  - `MNDPR7`/`MNDPR8`: Change logs.
